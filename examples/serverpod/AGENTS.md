# Serverpod project

This project is a Serverpod server (backend).

The server runs under the Serverpod runner, a background process per server package. The user attaches to it with `serverpod start`. There is no need to check if the server is running: make the changes and call the `serverpod` MCP tools as needed. If the server is not running, an informative error message will be received from the MCP server. Then call `tail_runner_logs` to learn whether it is still starting or why it stopped. If nothing is running, start it with `serverpod runner start` in `agent_weave_demo_server`, which returns once the server is up and leaves it running for the user to attach to. If it fails, fix the cause it reports (a build error, a port held by another process, Docker) instead of retrying; only a `serverpod runner start` your shell killed on a timeout is run again, since the runner keeps starting. Leave the runner running, and run `serverpod runner stop` only when asked.

While running, the runner watches for file changes to run incremental code generation and hot reload the running server. `serverpod runner status` prints its state and the server addresses, which are not always the configured ports when another Serverpod runner on the machine holds them.

Calling `serverpod generate` directly is not needed, but might be useful to troubleshoot when an incremental generation fails.

ALWAYS use the MCP server instead of the command line for the tasks below. The `serverpod runner` commands are the exception: they manage the stack itself. Use the MCP server to:

- `create_migration` and `apply_migrations` for database (after you change data models).
- `create_repair_migration` if the database has drifted out of sync with the migrations.
- `tail_server_logs` to read logs from the server.
- `tail_runner_logs` to read the output of the runner itself (code generation, compilation, Docker, raw server output). The only tool that also works while the server is starting or after it stopped.
- `hot_reload` / `hot_restart` to reload or restart the server. Use `hot_restart` for changes that hot reload cannot apply, such as changes to `main()`.

NEVER edit generated code. The server's `lib/src/generated/` directory and the whole `agent_weave_demo_client` package are rewritten by the code generator. Change the `.spy.yaml` models, the endpoints, or `lib/server.dart` instead.

Migrations are a narrow exception: the `migration.sql` of a generated migration MAY be edited by hand when the generated SQL would lose data — to add a data transformation, or to reach a destructive change through non-destructive steps. Never touch the other files in the migration directory, and keep the schema the SQL ends up with identical to `definition.sql` — new databases are created from that file and never run `migration.sql`.

Only when the MCP is not available or `serverpod runner start` cannot bring the server up, fall back to the CLI in the server package:

- `serverpod generate` to regenerate the client and the generated server code.
- `serverpod create-migration` after changing a model with a `table` (add `--force` for destructive changes). It only writes the migration; the runner applies pending migrations when it boots the server.

Tests need no Docker. `config/test.yaml` sets `database.dataPath`, so Serverpod starts and manages the test database (an embedded PostgreSQL) itself, and the project's `docker-compose.yaml` is not used for it. Just run `dart test` in the server package.

Checklist after doing changes, in this order:

- `dart analyze` (CLI)
- `dart format` (CLI)
- `create_migration` and `apply_migrations` (MCP - only if necessary)
- Do `serverpod` MCP `hot_restart` if required (hot reload is done automatically)
- Run tests, if applicable (`dart test` in the server package)
- Check `serverpod` MCP `tail_server_logs` for any issues.

## AgentWeave example

This example exercises the local AgentWeave packages. Native streaming and HTTP
SSE share the same agent factory and optional PostgreSQL store. The deterministic
model is the default. Set AGENT_WEAVE_USE_OPENAI=true and OPENAI_API_KEY only
in the server environment to use OpenAI. Tests always use the offline model. Never add credentials to Flutter code or committed config.
